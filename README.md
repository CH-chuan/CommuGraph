CommuGraph: Deep Analytics on Multi-Agent Chat Logs

**🚧 Code will be released by the end of Summer 2025. Stay tuned.**

CommuGraph is a tool designed to **visualize and analyze multi-agent chat logs**, providing deep insights into communication patterns, agent roles, and emergent structures. While many existing approaches rely on basic metrics like message counts, CommuGraph uncovers the **structure and flow** of conversations, helping researchers and developers make sense of complex multi-agent dynamics.

## 🔍 Overview

Multi-agent systems often operate through long-form chats that obscure key interaction dynamics. CommuGraph tackles this by transforming chat logs into **dynamic communication graphs**, where:

- **Nodes** represent agents, with size indicating activity level.
- **Edges** represent message flow, with thickness reflecting frequency and color indicating dominant intent (e.g., delegation, inquiry).

These graphs are then analyzed using classic network algorithms (e.g., centrality, clustering) to surface dominant, isolated, or emergent patterns in agent communication.

## ✨ Planned Features

- **Metadata extraction** from logs (sender, recipient, timestamp, step index, message type).
- **Directed communication graph** rendering and dynamic visualization.
- **Support for multiple frameworks**, starting with AutoGen and expanding to Camel, CrewAI, OWL, and OpenManus.
- **Interactive dashboard** to visualize evolving communication over time.

## 🎯 Why CommuGraph?

Understanding how agents **collaborate**, **delegate**, and **communicate** is key to:
- Improving multi-agent coordination strategies.
- Detecting communication breakdowns.
- Designing smarter, more explainable agent frameworks.

We envision communication graphs becoming a **core component** of multi-agent system evaluation, bridging the gap between system logs and human interpretability.

## 📅 Release Timeline

The first open-source release is planned for **late Summer 2025**. Until then, this repository serves as a placeholder for project updates.
